Hi! My name is Elie Diaz, and welcome to my website!

Currently, you'll find me doing research at the University of Utah and working on various graphics projects 
with the lab there, mostly focusing on physics-based simulation. I have also worked as a Research Intern for Roblox, 
where I developed a prototype for future Roblox projects! 

When not at the lab, you'll find me developing skills with my music endeavors, where I compete with several groups in
the barbershop scene, create multitrack recordings, and arrange music on the side!
